## Install
Use HACS and add as a custom repo. Once the integration is installed go to your integrations and follow the configuration options to specify the below:
- Username (Fordpass App)
- Password (Fordpass App)
- VIN Number
- Region (Where you are based, required for tokens to work correctly)

## Usage
Your car must have the lastest onboard modem functionality and have registered/authorised the fordpass application

### Car Refresh
I have added a service to poll the car for updates, due to the battery drain I have left this up to you to set the interval. The service to be called is "refresh_status" and can be accessed in home assistant using "fordpas.refresh_status". 

Optionally you can add the "vin" parameter followed by your VIN number to only refresh one vehicle. By default this service will refresh all registered cars in HA.

**This will take up to 5 mins to update from the car once the service has been run**
###
Click on options and choose imperial or metric to display in km/miles. Takes effect on next restart of home assistant. Default is Metric

### Clear Tokens
If you are experiencing any sign in issues, please trying clearing your tokens using the "clear_tokens" service call.
